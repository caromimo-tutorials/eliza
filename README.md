# Eliza chatbot

This is a simple implementation of the Eliza chatbot run with a script inspired by the ["functional core, imperative shell"](https://kennethlange.com/functional-core-imperative-shell/) pattern. The initial code is from the R bloggers website [here](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2021/01/eliza-chatbot-in-r-build-yourself-a-shrink/). 

To run this code, type `Rscript run.R` at the command line.

Happy session!
